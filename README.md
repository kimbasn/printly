## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- Go (version 1.21 or later)
- A Firebase project for authentication.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kimbasn/printly.git
cd printly
```

### 2. Configuration

The application is configured using environment variables. Create a `.env` file in the root of the project by copying the example file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Now, edit the `.env` file with your local configuration:

- **Database**: Set your PostgreSQL connection details (`DB_USER`, `DB_PASSWORD`, `DB_NAME`).
- **Firebase**:
    1. Go to your Firebase project settings -> Service Accounts.
    2. Generate a new private key and download the JSON file.
    3. Save this file in the project root (e.g., as `serviceAccountKey.json`).
    4. Set `FIREBASE_CREDENTIALS_FILE=./serviceAccountKey.json` in your `.env` file.

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
go mod tidy
```

### 4. Run the Application

#### Using Go

If you have a local PostgreSQL instance running, you can start the server directly:

```bash
make run
```

The API server will be available at `http://localhost:8080`.

---

## üìö API Documentation

Once the server is running, you can access the interactive Swagger API documentation at:

**<http://localhost:8080/swagger/index.html>**

This UI allows you to explore and test all the API endpoints. You can authorize your requests by obtaining a Firebase ID token from your client application and using the "Authorize" button.
