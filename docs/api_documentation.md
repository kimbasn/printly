    }
  ]
}
```

### `POST /upload`

Upload a document for printing.

This endpoint returns a time-limited `upload_url` to enable **secure, efficient, and scalable direct file uploads** to cloud storage (e.g., Google Cloud Storage or AWS S3) without routing the file through the backend server.

#### üì¶ Upload Flow

1. **Client calls** `POST /upload` with:

   ```json
   {
     "center_id": "center123",
     "file_name": "cv.pdf",
     "mime_type": "application/pdf"
   }
   ```

2. **Backend actions**:

   * Creates a new `Order` with a unique pickup `code`
   * Generates a **signed upload URL** using GCS SDK
   * Returns the upload URL and order metadata to the client

  ```json
  {
    "upload_url": "...",
    "expires_at": "..."
  }
  ```

1. **Client uploads** the document directly to the returned `upload_url` via HTTP PUT or POST

2. **Cloud triggers** notify backend when upload is complete

#### üõ°Ô∏è Security Considerations

* `upload_url` is **time-limited** (e.g., 10 minutes)
* It only allows upload to **one file location**
* It **does not expose storage credentials**
* The file is only accessible to the print center after upload and payment

{
  "center_id": "center123",
  "file_name": "cv.pdf",
  "mime_type": "application/pdf"
